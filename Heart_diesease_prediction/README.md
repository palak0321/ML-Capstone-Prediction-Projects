# Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using medical features.  
Classification algorithms are used to assist in early healthcare interventions.

## Problem Statement
Predicting heart disease early can save lives by providing timely treatments and lifestyle changes.

## Features Used
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Number of Vessels
- Thalassemia

## Technologies and Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Workflow
1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
5. Model Evaluation

## Model Performance
- Achieved approximately (Accuracy: 85%)

## How to Run
- Clone the repo.
